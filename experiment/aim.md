Welcome to the Virtual Lab on _Recursion_! In this lab, you will learn how to use recursion to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

Recursion is a powerful technique that allows us to solve complex problems by dividing them into simpler ones. It works by defining a function that calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly. By doing so, we can solve problems that would otherwise be too difficult or time-consuming to solve in one go.

The definition of GNU (the source of much free software) is said to be recursive because GNU stands for `GNU's Not Unix`, i.e. GNU is part of the definition of GNU! Or maybe two mirrors placed parallely! The nested images are a form of infinite recursion.

In this lab, we will explore the concept of recursion through interactive exercises. We will start with simple examples and gradually move on to more complex problems. Along the way, you will learn how to:

- Identify problems that can be solved using recursion
- Write recursive functions that solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
- Understand the role of base cases in terminating recursive functions
- Use recursion to solve real-world problems
- Appreciate the beauty and power of recursion in computer science

By the end of this lab, you will have gained hands-on experience in visualizing recursive code and understanding its inner workings. You will also develop problem-solving skills that will serve you well in your future.

So let's get started and discover the magic of recursion together!

> ### Pre-requisite

To get the most out of this lab, you should be familiar with the basics of programming in `Python/C/JavaScript`. You should also be comfortable with using functions and loops to solve problems.
