### Practice Assignment

1. **Reversing a String** (Beginner)

    Write a function `reverseString(str)` that takes in a string argument and returns the reverse of the given string.

    _Input_ -> `"Calvin and Hobbes"` \
    _Output_ -> `"sebboH dna nivlaC"`

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** (Beginner)

    Write a function `gcd(a, b)` that takes in two numbers and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

    _Input_ -> `gcd(8, 12)` \
    _Output_ -> `4`

    _Input_ -> `gcd(15, 10)` \
    _Output_ -> `5`

1. **nextIsDouble** (Intermediate)

    Write a function that takes a list, and return the number of elements in data that are followed directly by double that element.

    _Input_ -> `{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}` \
    _Output_ -> `8` \
    _Explanation_ -> The elements 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 are all followed directly by double their value. 

    _Input_ -> `{1, 0, 0, -5, -10, 32, 64, 128, 2, 9, 18}` \
    _Output_ -> `5` \
    _Explanation_ -> The elements 0, -5, 32, 64 and 9 are all followed directly by double their value.

1. **MaxConsecutiveSum** (Advanced)

    Write a function `maxConsecutiveSum(arr)` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of consecutive elements in the list. Consecutive elements are elements that appear in sequence without any gaps.

    _Input_ -> `maxConsecutiveSum([1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])` \
    _Output_ -> `9` \
    _Explanation_ -> The maximum sum of consecutive elements in the list is 9. The consecutive elements are 3, 4, -1, 2, 1.

    _Input_ -> `maxConsecutiveSum([2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3])` \
    _Output_ -> `8` \
    _Explanation_ -> The maximum sum of consecutive elements in the list is 8. The consecutive elements are 4, -1, -2, 1, 5.

1. **Binary Search** (Advanced)

    Write a function binarySearch(data, target) that takes in a sorted list and a target value and returns the index of the target value in the list. If the target value is not present in the list, return -1.

    _Input_ -> `binarySearch({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, 5)` \
    _Output_ -> `4`

    _Input_ -> `binarySearch({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, 11)` \
    _Output_ -> `-1`
